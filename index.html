        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I have studied Java substantially as part of IUP's curriculum.
          My classes included topics such as Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
          I have also taught myself a lot about the Python programming languages, experimenting with
          projects involving APIs and Flask frameworks, which can be viewed in my GitHub linked below.
          I have begun taking an online class in web development as well. Other topics I covered at IUP
          include Assembly Language (MIPS), COBOL, and SQL.

      <h3>Microsoft Office</h3>
      <p>I have been using Microsoft Office programs such as Word and PowerPoint ever since I got my first computer.
      However, I began studying the full Office Suite in depth in high school. I took two classes which taught me
      a lot about the wide variety of features in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Publisher. I also began using Outlook and Visio
      in college and have gotten quite familiar with thier interfaces.</p>
